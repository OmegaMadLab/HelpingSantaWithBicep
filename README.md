# Helping Santa with Bicep

This repository contains the demo I prepared for the sessions:
- ***Let's flex our Bicep to help Santa and his elves!*** delivered for the **Festive Tech Calendar 2021** event
- ***Fletti il tuo Bicep per aiutare Babbo Natale ed i suoi elfi!*** delivered at the **XmasDev 2021** conference

We want to help the elves implementing a DevOps approach while preparing their gifts.
To do this, we implemented three workflows via GitHub actions to govern a CI/CD process for their modules that ends with their publication into a Bicep registry.

If you want to try this demo, just have a look at the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBul3x_1xU&ab_channel=FestiveTechCalendar) I made for the Festive Tech Calendar, clone this repo and start by executing the **deploy.ps1** you can find in the **environmentPreparation** folder.
